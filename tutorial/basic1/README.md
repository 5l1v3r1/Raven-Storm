## To run a basic attack, you just need to execute ```rs.pyo```and enter following:

If your server has a domain use:
- Note that you need to own the whole network or you will go illegal.
- ```set web {https://yourprivatedomain.domain}```

If not use the IP:
- ```set ip {0.0.0.0}```

Define the port:
- ```set port {80}```

Define the amount of threads:
- Threads are the amount of processes trying to connect to the target.
- ```set threads {200}```

Now recheck everything:
- We dont want to get in trouble so we should recheck all the data.
- Please inform yourself about the law regarding to DDOS.
- ```values```
- You can ignore everything for now except the target, port and threads.

Execute:
- If you want to execute the attack, you need to enter ```run``` .
- You can always stop the attack by using ctrl + z .
