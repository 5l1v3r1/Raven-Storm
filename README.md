# Raven-Storm Toolkit Beta [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Feel%20free%20to%20try%20it%2C%20it%20is%20a%20costumizable%20ddos%20Framework&url=https://github.com/Taguar258/Raven-Storm&hashtags=pentesting)
A strong , costomizable ddos + dos script with over 30 functions/commands for testing your own server!(^^)

Its also special, because it uses a db for ddos.

You can use it's as a strong dos or connect did attacks together = ddos.

I wanted to make the most costomizable dos framework for you, here it is. (Still maintained)

It is completely free, if you have problems with the script write me.

If this is forked just look for the original repository, there are always updates.

I would be thankful, if you would give me a star in case you like it.
