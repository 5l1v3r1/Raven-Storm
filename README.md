# Raven-Storm [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Feel%20free%20to%20try%20it%2C%20it%20is%20a%20costumizable%20ddos%20Framework&url=https://github.com/Taguar258/Raven-Storm&hashtags=pentesting)
A strong , costomizable ddos + dos script with 25 functions/commands for testing your own server!(^^)

Its also special, because it uses a db for ddos.

You can use it's as a strong dos or connect did attacks together = ddos.


I wanted to make the most costomizable dos framework for you, here it is.
It is completely free, if you have problems with the script write me.

If this is forked just look for the original repository, there are always updates.

I would be thankful, if you would give me a star in case you like it.

## Running:
`git clone https://github.com/Taguar258/Raven-Storm`

`cd Raven-Storm`

pip2 install redis
<!--(pip2 install -r requirements.txt) if existing.-->

### Unstable:
That's the newest version, with dos + ddos function.

`python2 dos.pyo`

### Stable:
**I would only recommend this if dos.pyo does not work.**

The last stable version, no ddos but still the same.

`python2 dos-stable.pyc`

Type `help` for help.

## Python version:
Python2

## Version
(Beta)/Alpha 2.3

## In next version(currently under development):
Planed, will be a huge update with 12 new features.

## Install updates:
`chmod 777 update.sh`

`./update.sh`

#### or:

## Use DDOS:
First of you need to install redis:

Now you need to run `redis-server mac-redis.conf/other-redis.conf`in a new tab.
Now start up the script and connect to the redis db using: `server ip` and in case you need to: `server port`. 
Enter: `server start` for the server and `client connect`for the clients.
